# Knife plugin to generate README.md from metadata.rb

I've written a Knife plugin to generate a skeleton `README.md` file from a cookbook's `metadata.rb` file:

http://mlafeldt.github.com/knife-cookbook-readme

The plugin helps to

- create the first bits of documentation you can build upon
- write documentation that is consistent among your or your team's cookbooks
- implement the [DRY/SPOT](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself) rule (`metadata.rb` is the authoritative source of information)
