# List all repos of a GitHub user in Markdown format

Here is a quick shell script I wrote to get a list of my (public) GitHub repos:

https://github.com/mlafeldt/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/gh-repos

Simply pass it your GitHub user name.

The (rendered) output looks like this:

* [camplight](https://github.com/mlafeldt/camplight) - Python implementation of the Campfire API
* [cb2util](https://github.com/mlafeldt/cb2util) - CodeBreaker PS2 File Utility
* [gbp-cookbook](https://github.com/mlafeldt/gbp-cookbook) - Chef cookbook that installs and configures git-buildpackage
* [majek](https://github.com/mlafeldt/majek) - A preprocessor for Jekyll/Octopress blog posts that helps you to concentrate on writing
* [sharness](https://github.com/mlafeldt/sharness) - Shell library to test your Unix tools like Git does
